# Nuke-ToolEngine
NUKE provides a function called “tool-sets” to insert node collections into your node graph. Unfortunately this works only on a single workstation and NUKE doesn’t provide functionality to share tool-sets among multiple artists in a network. I developed GUI Based Tools for Production in NUKE, how to develop GUI-based tools for production in NUKE. I then set up a clean plug-in structure. The to work efficiently the code is outsourced into multiple modules. Finally, you'll develop the core functionality and helper functions for the plug-in. I created this plugin by following a tutorial on Pluralsight
